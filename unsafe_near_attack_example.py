# üî• CODE A: High-Risk Structure (Almost Executable Attack)
# ============================================================
# This code is close to a real-world abuse scenario.
# It uses real API URL and complete payload structure.
# Only the access_token is fake. If replaced, the attack would succeed.

    "reason_text": "This violates our standards."
}

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Would send request to Facebook API if token were real

# ‚úÖ CODE B: Safe Simulation Structure (Educational)
# ============================================================
# This version is completely safe. It simulates reporting
# without any real API, token, or network activity.
